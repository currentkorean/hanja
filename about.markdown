This site was created for Korean-language learners who wish to expand their vocabulary as quickly as possible.

<h4>Backstory</h4>
I grew up speaking Korean at home, but because I did not study the language formally I had only a basic vocabulary. I understood that familiarizing myself with hanja would help me gain a more advanced Korean vocabulary, but the hanja books I studied left me feeling frustrated. Their methods felt impractical to me because they introduced characters by theme or radical, rather than by frequency of use in the Korean language.

One day I stumbled upon the hanja lists used by Koreans who are studying for the 한자검정시험, an official exam that tests one's hanja ability. The lists are organized by frequency and level of difficulty. Learning hanja in this manner helped me absorb thousands of new words into my vocabulary very rapidly. I want others to benefit from this method too, so I created this English-language site to assist those who aren't ready to navigate the Korean sites.

<h4>How this site is organized</h4>
The hanja characters are organized by difficulty level, where 8급 is the easiest level and 특급 is the most difficult level. Within each 급 the characters are arranged alphabetically by their Korean pronunciation. Each hanja character has its own page, where I have attempted to list high-frequency words that are derived from the hanja.

Identifying all of the high-frequency vocabulary is not easy. My general rule of thumb is to include words identified in the Naver Dictionary as TOPIK I and TOPIC II words, as well as words with at least one star in the National Institute of Korean Language's Korean-English Learners' Dictionary. Due to limited time and resources, I generally do not define more than 20 vocabulary words per hanja page. I would like to create more comprehensive vocabulary lists in the future, but I suspect this will take several years to complete.
