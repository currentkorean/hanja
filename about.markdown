This site is inspired by the hanja notebooks I created (and continue to create) while studying Korean.

I had several false starts while learning hanja. I tried reading various English-language hanja books and was frustrated by all of them. These books attempted to make hanja easier for native English speakers by presenting hanja characters by themes or subjects rather than by frequency of use. When I used these books I did not notice an advantage to their methods. Rather, I felt like I was wasting mental energy trying to organize hanja characters in my head according to groups or themes.

One day I stumbled upon the hanja lists used by Koreans who are studying for the government hanja exam. The lists are organized by level of difficulty. Within each level (ê¸‰) the characters are organized alphabetically by sound. At first it felt dull to learn the characters alphabetically, but I stuck with the method because it felt more efficient. It worked. For the first time in years, I've been able to study hanja on a consistent basis, and it has made a big difference in my ability to understand and retain Korean vocabulary.

I have come to the conclusion that when it comes to learning hanja, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. It has been better for me to learn hanja in the same order as Koreans do for the government exam, rather than use an innovative method geared toward native English speakers. However, if you find the innovative methods useful, by all means keep using them. This site is for those wanting to stick with a more traditional method.

My personal hanja notebooks are written in Korean. I assume most visitors to this site are beginner and intermediate learners, so I have listed mainly high-frequency vocabulary and provided English definitions. Of course, English translations are often inadequate, and I am only human. The more advanced you are, the more you should rely on native Korean resources for vocabulary lists and definitions, not this website. 

Good luck with your studies. If you find any errors on the site or would like to provide feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
