This site is inspired by the actual hanja notebooks I created while studying Korean.

I had several false starts while learning hanja. I tried reading various English-language hanja books and was frustrated by all of them. These books attempted to make hanja "easier" for native English speakers by presenting hanja characters by themes or subjects rather than by frequency of use. Learning hanja in this manner left me with little ability to recall anything I had learned.

One day I stumbled upon the hanja list used by Koreans who are studying for the government hanja exam. ([Here](https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%95%9C%EC%9E%90/%EB%AA%A9%EB%A1%9D/%EA%B8%89%EC%88%98%EB%B3%84) is the list I relied upon.) 

<!--Edit this next part
Because the hanja list is made for Koreans, I was forced to read about the hanja characters in Korean. This was challenging at first, but I was able to understand and recall the hanja much better than I had when I was relying on my hanja books.

I came to the conclusion that it is far more practical to learn hanja the same way Koreans have been learning for ages, rather than some supposedly innovative method geared toward native English speakers. However, if you find the innovative methods useful, by all means keep using them. This site is for those wanting to try a more traditional method.

My original hanja notebooks were written in Korean. To assist learners at the beginner and intermediate levels, I have translated my notebooks back into English. I recommend that learners at the advanced level use the Naver hanja dictionary (or equivalent) to look up the hanja on their own.

Good luck with your studies. If you find any errors on the site or would like to provide feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
