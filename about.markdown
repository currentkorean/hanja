This site is inspired by the actual hanja notebooks I created while studying Korean.

I had several false starts while learning hanja. I tried reading various English-language hanja books and was frustrated by all of them. These books attempted to make hanja "easier" for native English speakers by 1) replacing the Korean definitions of the hanja characters with English definitions and 2) presenting hanja characters by theme rather than by frequency. Learning hanja in this manner left me with little ability to recall anything I had learned.

Then one day I discovered the hanja list used by Koreans who are studying for the government hanja exam. Since the hanja list is made for Koreans, I was forced to read the definitions in Korean. Understanding the definitions in Korean led to less frequent mixing up of hanja characters, because I understood the hanja at a different. Another advantage of the Korean hanja list is that the characters are arranged by frequency of occurrence. That meant that when I had a beginner vocabulary the beginner hanja was not overly challenging for me, and when I had an intermediate vocabulary the intermediate was not overly challenging for me. It was far more practical to learn hanja the same way Koreans have been learning for a long, and not some supposedly innovative method geared toward native English speakers. 

My hanja notebooks were written in Korean. To assist the beginner and intermediate learners, I have translated my notebooks back into English. This is the result.

I hope this is helpful. If you find any errors on the site or would like to provide feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
