This site is inspired by the actual hanja notebooks I created while studying Korean.

I had several false starts while learning hanja. I tried reading various English-language hanja books and was frustrated by all of them. These books attempted to make hanja "easier" for native English speakers by presenting hanja characters by themes or subjects rather than by frequency of use. Learning hanja in this manner left me with little ability to recall anything I had learned.

One day I stumbled upon the hanja list used by Koreans who are studying for the government hanja exam. Studying this list was challenging at first, especially since everything was written in Korean, but I eventually got the hang of things. After learning about 200 characters, my Korean vocabulary soared.

I came to the conclusion that when it comes to learning hanja, there is no need to reinvent the wheel. It was better for me to learn hanja the way Koreans have been learning for ages, rather than an innovative method geared toward native English speakers. However, if you find the innovative methods useful, by all means keep using them. This site is for those wanting to stick with a more traditional method.

My original hanja notebooks were written in Korean. To assist learners at the beginner and low-intermediate levels, I have translated my notebooks back into English. I recommend that learners at the high-intermediate and advanced levels use the Naver dictionary (or equivalent) to look up definitions in Korean.

Good luck with your studies. If you find any errors on the site or would like to provide feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me.
