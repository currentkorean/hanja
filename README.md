# hanja

I am using this repo to build a website with resources for learning hanja. This project was inspired by a hanja list used to study for the Korean government's hanja exam (https://namu.wiki/w/%ED%95%9C%EC%9E%90/%EB%AA%A9%EB%A1%9D/%EA%B8%89%EC%88%98%EB%B3%84). I would like to create a version of this for people who are learning Korean as a foreign language.

To Do:
  * Make a table of contents for each level (ê¸‰)
  * Create a post for each hanja character
  * Create a vocabulary list for each hanja character
  * Repeat 1000 times (approximately)

I am not an expert in anything and am open to ideas on how to improve this resource.
