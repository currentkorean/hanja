**What is hanja?**


**Do I need to learn hanja in order to learn Korean?**


**Why do you put so much effort into learning hanja if it is not required?**
Because it has helped me learn new vocabulary at a much faster rate. I was stuck at the intermediate levels of spoken and written Korean for half my life, and it wasn't until I started learning hanja that I finally broke through. Around the time I reached the 6ê¸‰ characters, I noticed I was able to read news articles and listen to formal speeches with relative ease.

**Who should learn hanja?**


**When will I start to see results?**
